## What is TunesRemote? ##

TunesRemote+ helps you remote control your [DACP-compatible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DACP) desktop or laptop media player from your Android device, such as:

  * [Apple iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/remote/)
  * [MonkeyTunes for MediaMonkey](http://melloware.com/monkeytunes/)
  * [AlbumPlayer](http://www.albumplayer.com/)
  * [Telescope for Songbird](http://addons.songbirdnest.com/addon/1764)
  * [foo\_touchremote for Foobar2000](http://wintense.com/plugins/foo_touchremote)
  * [RhythmBox for Gnome](http://live.gnome.org/SummerOfCode2010/AlexandreRosenfeld_Rhythmbox)

'''Digital Audio Control Protocol''' (DACP) is a protocol used by the Apple Inc.'s Remote application (app) on iOS devices to control iTunes running on a remote computer. This way mobile devices such as the iPhone/iPod/iPad and now Android can be used as a two way WLAN music remote control.

The original [TunesRemote](http://dacp.jsharkey.org/) material is Copyright 2008 Jeffrey Sharkey (http://dacp.jsharkey.org/) and released under Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license for documentation and GPLv3 for code.

The project was not being updated on Android Market yet many bug fixes and enhancements had been made by the community.  Many Android owners had contacted the team about releasing an updated version on the market to no avail.  Thus, the TunesRemote+ project was born so the project could live on and advance in the Android Market while being maintained by a larger group of members.

The code is released in the Android Market as TunesRemote+.
